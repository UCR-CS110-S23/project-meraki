project-meraki created by GitHub Classroom

## We decided to work on the alternative project option for our final project. 
Originally, we were working on Lab 6 on a separate GitHub repository so we had to clone this repository and push it into this one for the final project to maintain the commit history. Because of this, the commit history in this repo will contain commits from Labs 1-5.

## To only view the commit history for the alternative project, please start on May 29, 2023 as seen in the image below.
