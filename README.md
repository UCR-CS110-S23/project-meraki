# Meraki

## Project Description
Meraki is a web application that implements a sharing platform dedicated to creations made from home, or made by hand. It is akin to Instagram and Etsy, but domestic and not inherently for any profitable services. These creations include anything related to food, arts, home improvement, and more. 

## Software Used
For front-end we'll be programming with HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and Material UI. For back-end, we'll use NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express to manage the database of the users.
