#### Rules:

- For the two-player game, each player (X and O) has only 5 seconds to make a move/play. After the 5 seconds is up, the current player is skipped and the next player gets to make a move.

- For the game against AI, the player has only 5 seconds to make a move/play. After the 5 seconds is up, the AI will automatically make a move on the board.

- A whole game (i.e. for both the two-player and AI game modes) lasts for 2 minutes. If the 2 minutes are up and no player made a winning move, then the game ends and becomes a tie game.
